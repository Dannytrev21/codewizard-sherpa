# Cross-story lessons — Phase 02 stories

Append-only. Each entry: lesson · source story · how to apply it on the next attempt.

## L1 — `uv.lock` parity test trips on any new `[project.optional-dependencies]` entry
- **Source:** S1-01 (added `hypothesis` to `[dev]`).
- **Symptom:** `tests/unit/test_makefile_targets.py::test_uv_lock_is_in_lockstep_with_pyproject_dep_set` fails with `missing packages: ['<new-pkg>']`.
- **Fix:** After editing `pyproject.toml`'s dep set, run `uv lock` and commit the regenerated `uv.lock` in the same commit.
- **Why it matters:** Phase 2 stories add ≥ 7 new packages (per phase-arch §Step 1). Forgetting `uv lock` will break every story's CI until the next `uv lock` ships.

## L2 — Ruff's `UP007` + `UP017` rewrite Pydantic-discriminator-union sources
- **Source:** S1-01.
- **Symptom:** Story TDD-plan code blocks use `Union[X, Y]` and `timezone.utc` literally; ruff auto-rewrites to `X | Y` and `datetime.UTC` (rules `UP007`, `UP017` are enabled at `[tool.ruff.lint] select`).
- **Fix:** Apply ruff `--fix` after dropping in the story's prescribed code; the rewrites are safe under Pydantic v2 discriminated unions and Python 3.11+. Don't fight the linter; the codebase convention wins.
- **Why it matters:** Saves a round-trip on every Phase 2 story that copy-pastes story-prescribed type-alias blocks.

## L3 — Stale local venv hides missing `[dev]` extras
- **Source:** S1-01 (`hypothesis` and `import-linter` were both missing locally).
- **Symptom:** `pytest` collection fails on `import hypothesis`; `lint-imports` console script not on PATH.
- **Fix:** Before starting a story that adds a new tool to `[dev]`, run `.venv/bin/pip install -e .[dev]` (or `uv sync --extra dev`) so the venv reflects the pyproject. The CI fence catches the gap, but local cycles compound.
- **Why it matters:** Every Phase 2 story that uses Hypothesis (per phase-arch §"Testing strategy") or a new linter will hit this.
