# Cross-story lessons — Phase 02 stories

Append-only. Each entry: lesson · source story · how to apply it on the next attempt.

## L1 — `uv.lock` parity test trips on any new `[project.optional-dependencies]` entry
- **Source:** S1-01 (added `hypothesis` to `[dev]`).
- **Symptom:** `tests/unit/test_makefile_targets.py::test_uv_lock_is_in_lockstep_with_pyproject_dep_set` fails with `missing packages: ['<new-pkg>']`.
- **Fix:** After editing `pyproject.toml`'s dep set, run `uv lock` and commit the regenerated `uv.lock` in the same commit.
- **Why it matters:** Phase 2 stories add ≥ 7 new packages (per phase-arch §Step 1). Forgetting `uv lock` will break every story's CI until the next `uv lock` ships.

## L2 — Ruff's `UP007` + `UP017` rewrite Pydantic-discriminator-union sources
- **Source:** S1-01.
- **Symptom:** Story TDD-plan code blocks use `Union[X, Y]` and `timezone.utc` literally; ruff auto-rewrites to `X | Y` and `datetime.UTC` (rules `UP007`, `UP017` are enabled at `[tool.ruff.lint] select`).
- **Fix:** Apply ruff `--fix` after dropping in the story's prescribed code; the rewrites are safe under Pydantic v2 discriminated unions and Python 3.11+. Don't fight the linter; the codebase convention wins.
- **Why it matters:** Saves a round-trip on every Phase 2 story that copy-pastes story-prescribed type-alias blocks.

## L3 — Stale local venv hides missing `[dev]` extras
- **Source:** S1-01 (`hypothesis` and `import-linter` were both missing locally).
- **Symptom:** `pytest` collection fails on `import hypothesis`; `lint-imports` console script not on PATH.
- **Fix:** Before starting a story that adds a new tool to `[dev]`, run `.venv/bin/pip install -e .[dev]` (or `uv sync --extra dev`) so the venv reflects the pyproject. The CI fence catches the gap, but local cycles compound.
- **Why it matters:** Every Phase 2 story that uses Hypothesis (per phase-arch §"Testing strategy") or a new linter will hit this.

## L4 — `@runtime_checkable` `isinstance` silently mutates target classes' `__dict__`
- **Source:** S1-03 (adapter Protocols + `test_no_phase2_module_implements_adapter_protocol_dynamic`).
- **Symptom:** `tests/unit/test_errors.py::test_subclasses_are_markers_only` fails with `MalformedJSONError declares extra class attributes … '__annotations__'`. Reproduces only when `tests/unit/adapters/test_protocols.py` runs first.
- **Fix:** Any pkgutil-style walk that ends in `isinstance(inst, AnyRuntimeCheckableProtocol)` MUST filter out classes that cannot possibly satisfy the protocol *before* the isinstance call. For adapter-tier protocols, `issubclass(cls, BaseException)` is the right pre-filter — exceptions cannot satisfy `confidence()`/`consumers()`/etc., and skipping them sidesteps the side effect entirely.
- **Why it matters:** Phase 2's S4-01/02 will revisit dynamic protocol-conformance scans (`AdapterConfidence` consumers in `IndexHealthProbe`-adjacent code). The same trap fires there.

## L5 — Pytest collects any `Test*` class imported into a test file's namespace
- **Source:** S1-03 (`TestInventoryAdapter` raised `PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class … has a __init__ constructor`).
- **Symptom:** Importing `TestInventoryAdapter` (or any `Test*`-named class) into `tests/**/*.py` warns at collection time even when no test instantiates it.
- **Fix:** **Alias on import in the test file** — `from codegenie.adapters import TestInventoryAdapter as InventoryAdapter`. Do **not** set `__test__ = False` on the Protocol class (either inside or after the body): on Python 3.11 (CI), assigning `__test__` post-class-body adds it to `_get_protocol_attrs`, breaking `isinstance` for any stub that doesn't declare `__test__`. CI was green on Python 3.13 (local) and red on Python 3.11 (CI) — the `_get_protocol_attrs` implementation diverges across minor versions.
- **Why it matters:** Any future domain type that begins with `Test` (e.g., `TestMatrix`, `TestSuiteId`) needs the import-alias fix in test files, not a runtime mutation of the source class. Setting `__test__` on a Protocol is a portability trap.
